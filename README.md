# TDF_algorithm-classification

#Introduction	
TDF_algorithm classification is a collaborative application of the SC-R: a supervised classification methodology at https://github.com/SVMendoza/SC-R. 
This R TDF_algorithm classification code contains the functions for land cover classification for the identification of tropical dry forest, applied to a case in northern Colombia, in the area of potential distribution (PDA) of the TDF in the Department of CÃ³rdoba. For the use of the code, a shape file containing the control points and a raster file with the bands to be used for the supervised classification is required. In this case we used Sentinel 2 bands B2, B3, B4, NIR and NDVI with 10m resolution.
